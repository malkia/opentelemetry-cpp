# otel_sdk integratione example

The `x.cpp` has been copied from the `opentelemetry-cpp` examples folder (the "simple" examples), into single file.

In our version it links to the dynamic `opentelemetry-cpp` from the parent repo.

In the future I'll add static linking too, through the `dll_deps` macro.
